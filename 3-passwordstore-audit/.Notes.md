# About the project, in my words.

- A user should be able to set a password and can view it. Other users should not view it.
- The owner can update the password, the password cannot be updated by others.

# Attack vectors ideas

    - function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external

        1. Access control is not defined.
        2. Anyone can call this function but, Only the owner should call this function.
        3. Use the modifier onlyOwner

    - function getPassword() external view returns (string memory)

        1. No Access control
        2. Anyone can change view the password

# Updates || Changes by me.

     modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(s_owner == msg.sender, "Not the owner");
        _;
    }

---

Only the owner should be able to setPassword.

    function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external onlyOwner { //n no access control , needed onlyOwner
        s_password = newPassword;
        emit SetNetPassword();
    }
