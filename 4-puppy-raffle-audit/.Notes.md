# Notes for the 4-puppy-raffle-audit.

## About the protocol in my words.

This project is to enter a raffle to win a cute dog NFT.
Anyone can enter into the raffle as solo or as a team, To enter into raffle they need to pay a fee of `entrance fee * the number of players => entranceFee * newPlayers.length `. Duplicate address not allowed. 

Users are allowed to get a refund of their value if they call the `refund` function.

Every X seconds, the raffle will be able to draw a winner and be minted a random puppy.

The owner of the protocol will set a feeAddress to take a cut of the `value`, and the rest of the funds will be sent to the winner of the puppy.
