# 🛡️ Smart Contract Security  

Welcome to the **Smart Contract Security** repository! 🚀 This repo is dedicated to **learning, practicing, and applying security principles in Ethereum smart contracts**. It serves as a **comprehensive knowledge base** for vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, attack simulations, and real-world security audits.  

## 📌 What’s Inside?  

- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities** – Examples of common exploits like reentrancy, integer overflows, frontrunning, and more.  
- **Secure Solidity Patterns** – Best practices for writing **secure, gas-efficient, and upgradeable contracts**.  
- **Foundry-Based Security Testing** – Simulations of attacks and defenses using **Foundry**.  
- **Audit Reports & Analysis** – Security reviews of real-world smart contracts.  
- **Guides & Resources** – Checklists, references, and security frameworks to enhance your auditing skills.  

## 🚀 Learning Roadmap  

### **Phase 1: Understanding Vulnerabilities**  
✅ Learn **common exploits** (Reentrancy, Integer Overflows, Access Control, etc.)  
✅ Implement insecure contracts and exploit them in a **sandbox environment**  

### **Phase 2: Secure Smart Contract Development**  
✅ Study **secure Solidity patterns**  
✅ Implement **secure smart contracts** following best practices  

### **Phase 3: Foundry for Security Testing**  
✅ Learn **Foundry** for fuzzing, unit testing, and differential testing  
✅ Simulate **attack scenarios** and test mitigation strategies  

### **Phase 4: Smart Contract Auditing**  
✅ Read and analyze **real-world smart contracts**  
✅ Conduct **audit reports** and security assessments
